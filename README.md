# drawerflutter

In apps that use Material Design, there are two primary options for navigation: tabs and drawers. When there is insufficient space to support tabs, drawers provide a handy alternative.

In Flutter, use the Drawer widget in combination with a Scaffold to create a layout with a Material Design drawer. This recipe uses the following steps:

1.Create a Scaffold.
2.Add a drawer.
3.Populate the drawer with items.
4.Close the drawer programmatically.
